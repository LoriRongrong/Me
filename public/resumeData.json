Online survey is useful in that we can design the questions to collect a particular set of information. Through analysis the survey response, we hope non-trivial problems will be found. An alternative research method is to perform data analysis on mass review data from app store (which I hope can be used sometime in the future). ",

We also found that six out of thirteen responses from the open-ended question “Do you have any bad experience with using Google Calendar” mentioned about import/ export calendars. Therefore, we decided to tackle this feature to make it more intuitive for users. "

Google Calendar already has great features but sometimes users don’t find it intuitive enough. I think, from the perspective of information offload, it is always easier to flatten a product’s logic and make processes straightforward. "
